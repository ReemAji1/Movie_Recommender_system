# Movie_Recommender_system
In this project I will build a movie recommender system. The objective is to provide accurate movie recommendations to users. There are two types of recommendation systems – Content-Based Recommendation System and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation system. In this project, I will work on a collaborative filtering recommendation system and more specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system. The analysis will be done using the R programming language and I will make use of these four packages – ‘recommenderlab’, ‘ggplot2’, ‘data.table’ and ‘reshape2’.
